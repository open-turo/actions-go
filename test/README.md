# GitHub Action Test

GitHub Action that runs unit tests present within a go based GitHub repository and report test coverage metrics.

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - name: Test
        uses: open-turo/actions-go/test@v1
        with:
          ## example value for github-token provided below
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Note: by default, this action will perform actions/checkout as its first step.

## Test

repository and all subdirectories. Coverage metrics will be reported.

```shell
go test -cover ./...
```
